## Overview and Project Goals
The Overlook is a hotel booking site designed and built in 6 days. The goal of this Mod2 final solo [project](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/overlook.html) was to create a beautiful, responsive website that allows customers to view past hotel bookings, calculate the cost of their stays, and book upcoming stays.

### Learning Goals

To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:

- Implementing SCSS to DRY up repetitive styling
- Utilizing Lighthouse to pass ARIA audits
- Making network requests to API endpoints to retrieve, manipulate, and post data
- OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Creating an enjoyable user experience and responsive user interface
- Creating a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Functionality
